# Robot-Perception
The most simple and the most basic one.

This repository is based on python. It only shows the 3D diagram and perception by using points.
Here is what robot perception will show by using the point clouds.

Furthermore, we will also plot points in robots view, so that they can bypass obstacles.

In reality, we have x, y and z three dimensions. Whereas in robot vision, only 2D (u and v they can see) and for the z can be expressed as depth of their vision.
